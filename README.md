# Study Rooms
- This application, written in plain PHP with a MySQL backend, was developed over 8 years ago with no intention of public release.
- App settings are configured in a separate file and/or a table in the database.
- The app does not require or manage user accounts. For user authentication, we use the university's LDAP.
- All layout and presentation changes can be managed in plain CSS.
- A couple years ago, we updated the application with a compact responsive retrofit.
- Reservation interactions are handled via plain JavaScript. (It was written before any frameworks or libraries were as popular - and reliable - as they became.)
- Beyond a few updates, it has not seen or required any consequential maintenance.
